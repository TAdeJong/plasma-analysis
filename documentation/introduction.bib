abstract ={In astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and electrodynamics simulations, numerically enforcing the ∇·B= 0 constraint on the magnetic field has been difficult. We observe that for point-based discretization, as used in finite-difference type and pseudo-spectral methods, the ∇·B= 0 constraint can be satisfied entirely by a choice of interpolation used to define the derivatives of B. As an example we demonstrate a new class of finite-difference-type derivative operators on a regular grid which has the ∇·B= 0 property. This principle clarifies the nature of ∇·B≠ 0 errors. The principles and techniques demonstrated in this Letter are particularly useful for the magnetic field, but can be applied to any vector field. This Letter serves as a brief introduction to the method and demonstrates an implementation showing convergence.},

title = {GPU Prefilter for Accurate Cubic B-spline Interpolation},
volume = {55}, 
number = {1}, 
pages = {15-20}, 
year = {2012}, 
doi = {10.1093/comjnl/bxq086}, 
abstract ={Achieving accurate interpolation is an important requirement for many signal-processing applications. While nearest-neighbor and linear interpolation methods are popular due to their native GPU support, they unfortunately result in severe undesirable artifacts. Better interpolation methods are known but lack a native GPU support. Yet, a particularly attractive one is prefiltered cubic-spline interpolation. The signal it reconstructs from discrete samples has a much higher fidelity to the original data than what is achievable with nearest-neighbor and linear interpolation. At the same time, its computational load is moderate, provided a sequence of two operations is applied: first, prefilter the samples, and only then reconstruct the signal with the help of a B-spline basis. It has already been established in the literature that the reconstruction step can be implemented efficiently on a GPU. This article focuses on an efficient GPU implementation of the prefilter, on how to apply it to multidimensional samples (e.g. RGB color images), and on its performance aspects.},
