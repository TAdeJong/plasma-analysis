# plasma-analysis
Repository containing code used to calculate field lines by massive parallel Runge-Kutta integration in CUDA and extract topological winding numbers from it.

Also contains some Python code to plot resulting data.

This code was used to produce a part of the data and plots for Smiet et al., _Resistive evolution of toroidal field distributions and their relation to magnetic clouds_ (2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00005) (accepted in [Journal of Plasma Physics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics)).
